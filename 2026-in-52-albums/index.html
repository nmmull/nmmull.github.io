<h1 class="title">2026 in 52 albums</h1>
<p>
The concept's pretty simple.  One album per week, not necessarily <a href="https://nmmull.github.io">my</a>
favorite album of the week, not necessarily a new album, just one I
listened to and liked.

<a href="https://avaluna.bandcamp.com/album/ava-luna"><b>Ava Luna</b> by Ava Luna</a>
</p>

<p>
Ava Luna is era-defining for me (which essentially means I listened to
them in college).  <b>Electric Balloon</b> felt like a revelation (though I
would later learn it was basically a revival of no-wave in the style
of James Chance and the Contortions).  I remember being floored by
"Billz", the first single off <b>Infinite House</b>, with its oscillations
between crushing wall of noise and chill groove; urgent and virtuosic,
driven by the truly important questions: "who's gonna pay my bills?"
(also, gotta say, "Steve Polyester" is one of the best non-Pynchon
Pynchon character out there).  I was lukewarm on <b>Moon 2</b>, I enjoyed
it primarily in a second-order way, but it felt like it wasn't meant
for me (maybe for someone with stronger ties to Devo and Talking
Heads). I was bummed to hear in 2019 that we weren't gonna get any
more Ava Luna, but Carlos Hernandez and Felicia Douglass continued to
make music so it didn't feel <i>over</i> over (<b>On Folly</b> seemed very much
a continuation of the Ava Luna storyline).  Last week, getting a
sudden urge to listen back to <b>Moon 2</b> (maybe this time I'd "get it")
I learned that Ava Luna came out with an album last year (!). On first
listen I was, disappointed.  It has none of the pent-up energy, the
deep-cutting angst, less I-need-to-say-this-let-me-speak and more
getting-older-and-throwing-up-the-hands.  The album is a distillation
of everything that makes Ava Luna unequaled composers and musicians,
but I see parallels with the last Dirty Projectors project <b>Songs of
the Earth</b>, in which composition becomes the sole vehicle for
expression.  Despite this, I listened through again, and then again, and
again, and then it clicked: it's a damn fun album.  That I think is
the thread through everything they do.  They're a group of super
talented folks, getting together yet again to make music, building on
their years-worth of experiences, and the product is, simply put,
beautiful.  The banter at the end of "My Walk" makes me smile every
time I listen to it.

Lemons here) but, yeah, catharsis to the max, cathart all the way home
to this turned up loud in my little impreza.

Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by James Gaffigan</a>
</p>

<p>
This week I watched the BU Symphony Orchestra's first concert of the
year, whose program included a performance by Juan Shin─the CFA 2025
concerto competition winner─of the Korngold Violin Concerto.  And,
though hyperbolic, maybe with a touch of romanticism that parrots the
piece itself, I'd say this felt like a once in a lifetime experience.
Juan's playing was technically exquisite, graceful and easy, yet
charged.  The performance felt like a gift, especially with the
intimacy of the setting: a small audience in a university auditorium
on a Friday night (and, geez, what a stunning dress). It was the kind
of performances that makes me want to "pay it forward", to make sure I
too am giving in any way I can.  I chose this album simply as a token
(also the Britten is an all time favorite of mine).

</p>

<p>
With all that's going on in the AI-sphere, this 2019 AI-music
experiment feels almost quiant. It's a marked departure from Herndon's
previous albums; when listening to <b>Movement</b>, one has the feeling
that every synth began life as a sine wave and was molded to fit its
aural purpose, wrestled into submission and imbued with a sense of the
primordial.  In <b>PROTO</b>, Herndon takes the voice as the starting
point, and uses AI to aid the molding, a more powerful tool for a less
giving medium.  This is done to great effect, but I believe falls into
the trap of many early-AI projects: AI is used in the way that reverb
is used in recording, it creates "aura" but muddles personality
(compare Casals and Ma on the cello suites).  The AI of it all pushes
Herndon towards "the middle", welcoming more than usual (not
unflattering) comparisons─I get flavors of Oneohtrix Point Never,
Caroline Shaw, Julia Holter, Purity Ring, and it's hard not to think
of Imogen Heap, at least for folks listening to music in the aughts.
Taken as an experiment (as I think it's intended) <b>PROTO</b> is
ground-breaking, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather address the
AI-music problem.

Ambient can sometimes be inscrutable (at least for me) but
occasionally you get lucky with the context in which you first hear a
piece of ambient.  I was in a weird place in my life, staring out at a
pond on a cool fall day while my car was getting serviced.  The
emergent overtones and relentlessly compressed bass drones of the
synthesizer just worked for this scene and headspace.

<p>
Every so often, I need to listen to Evans.  And after week one of
the spring semester, I needed something with quiet strength.  Evans
for me straddles the Burkian beauty-sublime divide, the decisions
he makes with regard to phrasing seem written in the clouds.  I
also kinda love Eddie Gomez's buzzy bass in this recording, it
brings out the lightness and occasional humor of it all.

<p>
Dabin Ryu has classical-pianist-energy.  The opener "Vertigo" has
Ólafsson precision (sub Bach for post-bop) and the intro of "In the
Land of Oo-Bla-Dee" plays like a Prokofiev piano sonata.  Also goes
without saying, Joe Martin (bass) and Johnathan Blake (drums) hold
their own, and have plenty of their own shining moments.

An unexpected but natural collaboration, the 17 minute ad-hoc live
session "I Got Your Password" is unreal.  This album has been on my
listening queue for years, but I think aptly captures 2026's
off-the-bat absurdities.

Unapologetically catchy, produced enough to not feel like a demo tape,
but not so much that it has the sometimes-cloying polish of recent
Waxahatchee (full disclosure, I have a sweet tooth).  "Angel Wings" is
the first ear-worm in a while I've enjoyed having.
