NumPy is a Python library for scientific computing. This means
different things to different people, but in the context of CS132,
NumPy is a library for doing linear algebra in Python.
</p>

<p>
One thing I want to emphasize: for the things we do in CS132, we don't
<i>have</i> to use NumPy. We could in principle implement everything that
we need in vanilla Python using 2D Python lists (i.e., lists of
lists). There isn't much to learn about NumPy except the names of
functions and a couple conventions. That is to say: if you know how to
program in Python using 2D lists, then the jump to using NumPy is a
small one.
</p>

<p>
Why, then, do we use NumPy?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even though we <i>could</i> write all the functions we need ourselves,
it's nice when we don't have to.</li>
<li>Even if we <i>did</i> write all the functions we need ourselves, our
implementations would almost certainly not be as fast as the ones in
the NumPy library.</li>
<li>Its a useful skill to have since its a widely used library.</li>
</ul>
<div id="outline-container-org613f3ac" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org613f3ac">Importing the Library</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org613f3ac">
<p>
Regardless, let's start from the beginning. As with any Python
library, we access the functions in it using an <code>import</code> statement.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">import numpy
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's generally good practice to only import the functions you need,
but NumPy is quite large (and has some cases of name clashes) so it's
typical to bind the name <code>numpy</code> to something shorter:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">import numpy as np
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can then refer to any function from the NumPy library in our own
code via dot notation: <code>np.useful_lin_alg_function()</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgbb705da" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbb705da">NumPy Arrays</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbb705da">
<p>
The fundamental object of NumPy is the <code>ndarray</code>. The <code>nd</code> part refers
to "n-dimensional." We will only ever consider 1D or 2D arrays, but
NumPy can support any number of dimensions (e.g., if a matrix is a
rectangle of numbers, a 3D array is a rectangular prism of
numbers).
</p>

<p>
<code>ndarray</code> objects are similar to Python lists, and it's common to
construct <code>ndarray</code> objects from Python lists using the constructor
<code>array</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
</pre>
</div>

<p>
They differ quite a bit from Python lists <i>internally</i>, but as we will
use them, they really only differ in some of their properties and
operations, which we will cover throughout this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
We will be constructing almost exclusively 1D and 2D <code>ndarray</code> objects
(which I will call NumPy arrays moving forward). A 1D NumPy array can
be constructed from a 1D Python list as above. A 2D NumPy array can be
constructed from a 2D Python list (i.e., a list of lists).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since NumPy arrays are optimized for use in linear algebra, it's not
possible to construct a NumPy array from a Python list that cannot be
interpreted as a matrix, i.e., when one of it's elements is not a
list, or not the same length as the others.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">try:
    a = np.array([1, [2, 3], [4, 5]])
except:
    print("No dice")
try:
    a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]])
except:
    print("No dice")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can use the <code>ndim</code> property to determine the dimension an NumPy array.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

assert(a.ndim == 1)
assert(b.ndim == 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Roughly speaking, we will use 1D numpy arrays to represent (column)
vectors and 2D numpy arrays to represent matrices. This is often
confusing at first because we get used to thinking of column vectors
as a special kind of matrix, and because 1D numpy arrays are displayed
horizontally (as a row) instead of vertically (as a column). This is
something we have to come to terms with.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5867e84" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5867e84">Shape</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5867e84">
<p>
NumPy arrays have a property called <code>shape</code> which tells us the number
of entries of an array, in the case of a 1D arrays, and the number of
rows and columns (presented as a tuple) in the case of 2D arrays.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

assert(a.shape == (6,))
assert(b.shape == (3, 2))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So if we want to represent an <code>m x n</code> matrix, then we need to
construct a 2D numpy array with the shame <code>(m, n)</code>. Note that the
shape of a 1D array is a 1-element tuple, so if we interpret
<code>a.shape[0]</code> to be the number of its rows, as is the case for 2D
arrays, then really a 1D array represents a <i>column</i>.
</p>

<p>
I find it useful to keep around functions for the number of rows and
columns of NumPy arrays; it can help quite a bit with readability.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
num_of_rows = lambda a: a.shape[0]
num_of_cols = lambda a: a.shape[1]

assert(num_of_rows(a) == 3)
assert(num_of_cols(a) == 2)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf495df2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf495df2">Operations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf495df2">
<p>
Many of the operations on vectors and matrices that we discuss in this
course are built into the NumPy library. For example, addition and
scaling for vectors and matrices are done via the usual binary
operators.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
b = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]])

assert(np.array_equal(a + b, np.array([[2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]])))
assert(np.array_equal(2 * b, np.array([[2, 2], [2, 2], [2, 2]])))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In particular, these operations are different than addition and
multiplication of Python lists.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
b = [[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]]

assert(a + b == [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]])
assert(2 * b == [[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]])
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<i>An Aside.</i> Note the use of <code>np.array_equal</code> above for comparing two
arrays for equality. This should be used cautiously; we often are not
interested if two arrays are equal, but if they are sufficently close
to each other. For this we can use <code>np.allclose</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">x = 0.3
y = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
a = np.array([x, x, x])
b = np.array([y, y, y])

assert(not np.array_equal(a, b))
assert(np.allclose(a, b))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Another important thing to note here is the <code>*</code> operator does <b>not</b>
implement matrix multiplication as we have discussed it. Rather, it
implements entry-wise multiplication, similar to addition. Standard
matrix multiplication is done via operator <code>@</code>. And when applied to 1D
arrays, it is the standard dot product.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1])

assert(np.array_equal(a * a, np.array([[1, 4], [9, 16]])))
assert(np.array_equal(a @ a, np.array([[7, 10], [15, 22]])))
assert(b @ b == 4)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf6e83e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcf6e83e">Indexing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcf6e83e">
<p>
The simplest and most common operation on NumPy arrays is accessing
their elements. We can index them in the same way we index Python
lists. In particular, we access entries in a 1D array in exactly the
same way we would Python lists, but there are a couple special
indexing tricks for 2D arrays that we will use frequently.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
We can access an individual row of a 2D array by indexing it as we
normally would if it were a 2D Python list. The caveat is that a row
is represented as a 1D array, which we have already noted represents
a <i>column</i>. This is a feature, not a bug, because we often want to
use a row as a column vector in later calculations.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
r1 = a[0] # note the zero-indexing!
assert(np.array_equal(r1, np.array([1, 2])))
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
We can index with tuples to access individual entries, as opposed to
double indexing (though both work).
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

assert(a[1, 1] == 4)
assert(a[1][1] == 4)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
We can access columns using <i>slicing</i>, a commonly used tool for
Python lists. The trick is that we can include a slice <i>in a tuple</i>
that we use for indexing. So to get a column, we use the slide <code>:</code>
as the first entry of the tuple we use for indexing. This says that we
want the first entry of the tuple to range over all possible elements.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

assert(np.array_equal(a[:,0], np.array([1, 3])))
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
We can access multiple columns or multiple rows at a time either by
indexing on <i>lists</i> or by slicing as above. The first is useful if
we want to rearrange rows or columns. The second is useful if we
want to grab a chunk of an array.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = np.array([[4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3]])
c = np.array([[4, 5], [1, 2]])

a[[0, 1]] = a[[1, 0]]

assert(np.array_equal(a, b))
assert(np.array_equal(b[:,:-1], c))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the second example, we're indexing b at a tuple of slices which
says "all possible first values and all but the last possible
second value." This will give you all of the <i>columns</i> except the
last one.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8083caf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8083caf">Stacking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8083caf">
<p>
A technique we have used several times, but which has been hidden from
you behind helper functions, is stacking. We commonly need to add a row
or a column to a matrix or combine to matrices into a single
matrix. We can do this via <code>np.hstack</code> and <code>np.vstack</code>, which take
tuples of arrays and stacks them either <i>horizontally</i> or <i>vertically</i>
(per the name of the function). One important thing to keep in mind,
and which will be a challenge in becoming comfortable with these
functions, is that they must be applied to arrays of the same
dimension, and the sides along which we are stacking must coincide. In
particular, we cannot stack a 1D array on a 2D array, but we <i>can</i>
make a 1D array into a 2D array and then stack it. Here is an example
in which we horizontally stack a vector to the right of a matrix,
something we often do if we want to create an augmented matrix out of
a matrix equation.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([5, 6])
c = np.array([[1, 2, 5], [3, 4, 6]])

b.shape = (2, 1) # we can change the shape to make it 2D

assert(np.array_equal(np.hstack((a, b)), c))
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org65a2875">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
NumPy arrays are not copied on reassignment. This is something we
just have to remember. If we want a copy of an array, we can use the
function <code>np.copy</code>. There are other more efficient ways to manage
array copying, but this will be sufficient for now.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = a
c = np.copy(a)

a[0] = -1

assert(b[0] == -1)
assert(c[0] == 1)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>NumPy arrays require that all of their entries are the same
type. When you construct a NumPy array, it will perform conversions
in order to make this the case. We've seen this in passing when
we've set one of the entries of a matrix to a <code>float</code> so that every
entry is converted to a float. We can use the property <code>dtype</code> to
determine the type of entries in an array. Except in a few
outstanding circumstances, we will be using arrays with floating
point entries.</li>
<li>NumPy array can be iterated over just like Python lists. If we want
to iterate over the rows of a matrix, we just have to iterative over
the elements of the array (a matrix is represented as an array of
its rows). If we want to iterative over its columns we can iterative
over the rows of its transpose (see below).</li>

There many useful functions in NumPy that cannot be put into a single
short tutorial. As we close this out, here is a list of functions that
may be worth frequently referring to. It's not exhaustive, but
hopefully is a starting point. Eventually, you will have to <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html">read the
docs</a> yourself to learn more.
