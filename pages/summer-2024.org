This is a log of the random projects I've worked on in the summer of
2024, mostly reading and writing.  It's my immodest way of enforcing
some productivity.  Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about
anything below (as fun as learning things is, talking about
things I've learned is a joy of its own).

* Reading
** *How Do We Look*, Mary Beard
** *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, Friedrich Nietzsche
** *The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air*, SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard
** *Angels and Saints*, Eliot Weinberger /(current)/
