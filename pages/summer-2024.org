This is a log of the random projects I've worked on in the summer of
2024, mostly reading and writing.  It's my immodest way of enforcing
some productivity.  Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about
anything below (as fun as learning things is, talking about
things I've learned is a joy of its own).
* Reading
** *How Do We Look*, Mary Beard
** *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, Friedrich Nietzsche
** *The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air*, SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard
** *Elm Guide*, Evan Czaplicki ([[https://guide.elm-lang.org][link]])
*** Honestly, I skimmed it
** *Angels and Saints*, Eliot Weinberger
** *Art in the After-Culture*, Ben Davis
*** Highly recommended
** *The Threepenny Opera*, Bertolt Brecht
** *The Pillowman*, Martin McDonagh
** *Crime and Punishment*, Fyodor Dostoevsky
** *Means and Ends*, Zoe Baker /(current)/
* Projects
** *Visualizers for Stack-Oriented Languages*
+ While teaching CS320, I spent a lot of time walking through the
  evaluation of stack oriented languages.  I'd like to use Elm to
  build nicer visualizations of this process.
+ [[file:stack-vis-prototype.html][A rudimentary prototype]]
+ [[file:diane-proto-ii.html][A slightly more interesting prototype]]
+ [[file:diane-proto-iv.html][A mock-up playground for a simple language]]
** *Overture: A Personal Agda Library*
+ I'd like to spend more time digging into the [[https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib][Agda standard library]].
  As an exercise in library management, I'm also extending it.
+ /Disclaimer./ I have no intention of maintaining this beyond
  personal use.
+ [[https://github.com/nmmull/Overture][The repository]]
** *Fermat's Little Theorem in Agda*
+ For their final project, a student in CS400 attempted to prove
  Fermat's little theorem in Agda (without the standard library).  I
  was impressed by how far they got, but eventually things get tricky
  when you start reasoning about summations.  I decided to put
  together a proof myself using the standard library.  It was hairer
  than I expected...
+ The proof appears in the Overture repository.
** *Diane: A Toy Stack-Oriented Language*
+ I built my first larger-scale prototype of a visualizer for a
  stack-oriented language
