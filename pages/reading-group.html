<h1 class="title">A Pedagogy Reading Group</h1>
<p>
This is the landing page for an informal reading group on pedagogy at
Boston University.  We meet a couple times a semester to discuss
anything and everything pedagogy and teaching.  The intended audience
is anyone teaching (or who will teach) courses at BU who wants to
think more about their practice.
</p>

<p>
If you want to be added to the email list for this group (or if you
want to be removed from the email list), please send a message to
<code>nmmull at bu dot edu</code>.  <b>If you're interesting in leading a
discussion</b> on a paper/book chapter that you read, or just a discussion
of the form "this is what I've been thinking about recently", please
send an message.

<b>outline:</b> There were a bunch of interesting-looking papers out of
<a href="https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org">SIGCE</a> this year, I'd like to chat about some of the ones that caught
my eye.  The two main papers I'd like to discuss are
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630846">Experiences of Undergraduate Computer Science Students Living with Mental Health Conditions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630953">Transforming Grading Practices in the Computing Education Community</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
They're kind of hard to read, but I'd like to more directly confront
the challenges that students face outside of the courses I teach.  I
think there's a lot of space here to talk about our experiences,
failures, and solutions (in any field).
</p>

<p>
We likely won't have time to discuss them but I also want to include
these papers, which are more specific to computer science.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626252.3630904">Participatory Governance in the Computer Science Theory Classroom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3626252.3630871">How We Manage an Army of Teaching Assistants: Experience Report on Scaling a CS1 Course</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Though not perfect, I think they offer potential solutions to
creating more accessible computer science courses, even at scale.
