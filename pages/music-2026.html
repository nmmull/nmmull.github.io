<h1 class="title">2026 in 52 albums</h1>
<p>
The concept's pretty simple.  One album per week, not necessarily my
favorite album of the week, not necessarily a new album, just one that
I listened to and liked.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<b>Snocaps</b> by Snocaps
</p>

<p>
Unapologetically catchy, produced enough to not feel like a demo
tape, but not so much that it has the sometimes-cloying polish of
recent Waxahatchee.  "Angel Wings" is the first ear-worm in a while
I've enjoyed having.

<b>With Greg from Deerhoof</b> by Serengeti
</p>

<p>
An unexpected but natural collaboration, the 17 minute ad-hoc live
session "I Got Your Password" is unreal.  This album has been on my
listening queue for years, but I think aptly captures 2026's
off-the-bat absurdities.

<b>Trio!</b> by Dabin Ryu
</p>

<p>
Dabin Ryu has classical-pianist-energy.  The opener "Vertigo" has
Ólafsson precision (sub Bach for post-bop) and the intro of "In the
Land of Oo-Bla-Dee" plays like a Prokofiev piano sonata.  Also goes
without saying, Joe Martin (bass) and Johnathan Blake (drums) hold
their own, and have plenty of their own shining moments.
</p></li>

<b>On A Friday Evening</b> by the Bill Evans Trio
</p>

<p>
Every so often, I need to listen to Evans.  And after week one of
the spring semester, I needed something with quiet strength.  Evans
for me straddles the Burkian beauty-sublime divide, the decisions
he makes with regard to phrasing seem written in the clouds.  I
also kinda love Eddie Gomez's buzzy bass in this recording, it
brings out the lightness and occasional humor of it all.
