<h1 class="title">2026 in 52 albums</h1>
<p>
The concept's pretty simple.  One album per week, not necessarily my
favorite album of the week, not necessarily a new album, just one that
I listened to and liked.
</p>

<li><p>
<b>Snocaps</b> by Snocaps
</p>

<p>
Unapologetically catchy, produced enough to not feel like a demo
tape, but not so much that it has the sometimes-cloying polish of
recent Waxahatchee.  "Angel Wings" is the first ear-worm in a while
I've enjoyed having.

<b>With Greg from Deerhoof</b> by Serengeti
</p>

<p>
An unexpected but natural collaboration, the 17 minute ad-hoc live
session "I Got Your Password" is unreal.  This album has been on my
listening queue for years, but I think aptly captures 2026's
off-the-bat absurdities.

<b>Trio!</b> by Dabin Ryu
</p>

<p>
Dabin Ryu has classical-pianist-energy.  The opener "Vertigo" has
Ólafsson precision (sub Bach for post-bop) and the intro of "In the
Land of Oo-Bla-Dee" plays like a Prokofiev piano sonata.  Also goes
without saying, Joe Martin (bass) and Johnathan Blake (drums) hold
their own, and have plenty of their own shining moments.

<b>On A Friday Evening</b> by the Bill Evans Trio
</p>

<p>
Every so often, I need to listen to Evans.  And after week one of
the spring semester, I needed something with quiet strength.  Evans
for me straddles the Burkian beauty-sublime divide, the decisions
he makes with regard to phrasing seem written in the clouds.  I
also kinda love Eddie Gomez's buzzy bass in this recording, it
brings out the lightness and occasional humor of it all.
</p></li>

<b>Magnetism</b> by the Kali Malone + Drew McDowall
</p>

<p>
Ambient can sometimes be inscrutable (at least for me) but
occasionally you get lucky with the context in which you first hear
a piece of ambient.  I was in a weird place in my life, staring out
at a pond on a cool fall day while my car was getting serviced.
The emergent overtones and relentlessly compressed bass drones of
the synthesizer just worked for this scene and headspace.

<b>PROTO</b> by Holly Herndon
</p>

<p>
With all that's going on in the AI-sphere, this 2019 AI-music
experiment feels almost quiant. It's a marked departure from
Herndon's previous two albums; when listening to <b>Movement</b> and
<b>Platform</b>, one has the feeling that every synth began life as a
sine wave and was molded to fit its aural purpose, wrestled into
submission and imbued with a sense of the primordial.  In <b>PROTO</b>,
Herndon takes the voice as the starting point, and uses AI to aid
the molding, a more powerful tool for a less giving medium.  This
is done to great effect, but I believe falls into the trap of many
early-AI projects: AI is used in the way that reverb is used in
recording, it creates "aura" but muddles personality (compare
Casals and Ma on the cello suites).  The AI of it all pushes
Herndon towards "the middle", welcoming more than usual (not
unflattering) comparisons─I get flavors of Oneohtrix Point Never,
Caroline Shaw, Julia Holter, Purity Ring, and it's hard not to
think of Imogen Heap, at least for folks listening to music in the
aughts.  Taken as an experiment (as I think it's intended) <b>PROTO</b>
is ground-breaking, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather tackle
the AI-music puzzle.

<b>Britten &amp; Korngold: Violin Concertos</b> by Vilde Frang, with the
Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by James Gaffigan
</p>

<p>
This week I watched the BU Symphony Orchestra's first concert of
the year, whose program included a performance by Juan Shin─the CFA
2025 concerto competition winner─of the Korngold Violin Concerto.
And, though hyperbolic, maybe with a touch of romanticism that
parrots the piece itself, I'd say this felt like a once in a
lifetime experience.  Juan's playing was technically exquisite,
graceful and easy, yet charged.  The performance felt like a gift,
especially with the intimacy implicit in the setting: a small
audience in a university auditorium on a Friday night (and, geez,
what a stunning dress). It was the kind of performances that makes
me want to "pay it forward", to make sure I too am giving in any
way I can.  I chose this album simply as a token (also the Britten
is an all time favorite of mine).
