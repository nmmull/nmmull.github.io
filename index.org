I'm a lecturer in the [[https://www.bu.edu/cs/][Department of Computer Science]] at [[https://www.bu.edu][Boston
University]]. Outside of teaching, I'm interested generally in logic and
computing. I've spent some time thinking about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_complexity#SAT_solvers][proof complexity and
SAT-solvers]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_type_system][pure type systems and normalization]]. Check my [[file:pdfs/CV.pdf][CV]] for
more information.
